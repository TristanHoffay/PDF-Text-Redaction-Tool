 This is where your PDF documents that you wish to redact information from should go.
 Don't worry, the files in this folder will NOT be modified by the program in any way. All saved files are written to the output directory.
However, do realize that all PDF files in this directory will be loaded into the program. Redacting from all documents and saving all documents will affect all files in this directory, so be careful not to cause unintended changes or overwrite files that you forgot to remove.
